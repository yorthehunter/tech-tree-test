    "Pickers today pick a single Fix at a time until it is complete, then move
    on to the next Fix. This is inefficient and weâ€™ve determined through
    experimentation that we could improve this process through a system called
    Batch Picking to LPN. This system should be a simple solution that we can
    put in place with a minimal amount of resources and in a very short time."
